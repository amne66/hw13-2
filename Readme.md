# Homework 13

Today's homework is to make our own small react clone, by using fastify to serve multiple pages through the static module (just like we practiced today in the class)

## Requirements
the required pages are as follows:
- a resume page, (feel free to either have a pdf of your resume or just write a couple of your experiences that looks like your resume design)
- an about me page, basically a page with your contact information, (like your name, personal website, phone number,etc...)
- a page that returns an alternating images layout of your interests with small descriptions about them  (like the following page)

## Notes
- you need this to be deployed on heroku (or any other platform [GITHUB PAGES WON'T WORK FOR THIS])
- you need to have a components based layout with you only changing the content of the page, but returning the entire html page
- the design of the pages is up to you, just don't make then 1990's style pages 
- you don't have to put your information if you are not comfortable with that
